0. Analyze your results, when does it make sense to use the various approaches?
It makes sense that when the size is large enough cuBlas < Tiled< GPU< CPU, but I didn't expect that when the size is small, CPU is actually the fastest.

1. How did your speed compare with cuBLAS?
cuBlas is 5x faster compared to the tiled version. This is probably because I set my tile size to the same, and is too small compared to the size.

2. What went well with this assignment?
The trend shown in retrieved data is as expected. 

3. What was difficult?
Going through the cuBlas library, understand which function to use.

4. How would you approach differently?
There isn't a different approach to me, so my approaches will remain the same. 

5. Anything else you want me to know?
Nope
